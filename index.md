I'm a first year physics PhD student at [MIT's Center for Theoretical Physics -- a Leinweber Institute](https://physics.mit.edu/research/labs-centers/mit-center-for-theoretical-physics-leinweber-institute/).
Before MIT, I obtained my bachelors degree in Mathematics and Physics from Case Western Reserve University in Spring 2025.

My current research interests lie at the intersection of theoretical and data-driven cosmology. 
For snippets of the physics I've done prior, see my [research]({{site.github.url}}/research) page (or my [CV]({{site.github.url}}/ananda_smith_cv.pdf), if you're feeling particularly nosy).
