Little comes close to being as theatrical as exploding stars, which is what led me to dabble in neutron star merger physics within Caltech's [WAVE Fellows program](https://sfp.caltech.edu/undergraduate-research/programs/wavefellows) in 2024.
Supervised by [Elias Most](https://comp-relastro.caltech.edu/), I used the [AthenaK](https://github.com/IAS-Astrophysics/athenak) framework to perform relativistic MHD simulations of a neutron star merger remnant launching a highly magnetized "monster shock" into the surrounding ejecta material.
Collaborators are modeling nucleosynthesis atop my simulations to better understand the electromagnetic transients arising from these sorts of events.
