In cosmology one typically assumes the spatial geometry of the Universe to be isotropic, but is this correct? 
Supervised by [Craig Copi](https://physics.case.edu/faculty/craig-j-copi/) and [Glenn Starkman](https://physics.case.edu/faculty/glenn-starkman/), I played around with this question by working on cosmologies with *anisotropic* spatial geometries.
(We specifically looked at cosmologies whose spatial sections are endowed with one of the five anisotropic [Thurston geometries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrization_conjecture).
To the right is a render of a tiliing on one such geometry, *Nil*, shamelessly taken from [here](https://3-dimensional.space/).)
The cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropies induced by the background evolution (i.e., without perturbations!) of these cosmologies allows us to constrain their curvature stringently; see our [paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2025/01/005) for details.
