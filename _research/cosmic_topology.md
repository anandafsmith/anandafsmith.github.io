Craig and Glenn also supervised my senior thesis, in which I worked with the [COMPACT collaboration](https://github.com/CompactCollaboration) on examining cosmologies that are spatially flat but *non-orientable*.
Non-orientable topologies enforce non-trivial boundary conditions (illustrated by the "worm diagram" I made on the right) on a cosmology, which could manifest in detectable signatures on the statistics of cosmological observables.
I computed the CMB temperature and polarization correlation matrices induced by primordial gravitational waves in these cosmologies.
These will be evaluated numerically by other COMPACT folks soon, enabling future investigations of our Universe's topology.
